            <h1 style="color: rgb(20, 160, 220);">Technology is cool</h2>
            <h3 style="color: rgb(20, 160, 220);">And I would like to learn it</h3>
            <h4 style="color: rgb(20, 160, 220);">Which is why I'm requesting a seat in the school I would like to go to learn about technology</h4>

            <p class="explanation" style="color: rgb(20, 220, 80);">
                Technology in this time is very important, and is in every aspect of our life. It's in a lot of everyday objects, like your phone, your toaster, your lightbulbs, your microwave, etc... 
                It's used to do many simple tasks aswell, like cooking, researching (usually), and much more.
                That's why I want to learn it, to understand what complex things happen behind our everyday objects. How does a computer work? How do batteries work? How does my stove work? I want to understand how it happens, and learn about the science behind it, especially computers.
                I'm very interested in computer science, and how our devices work.
                The paragraph below speaks about why I would want to go to these schools, other than the importance of this knowledge in life.

            <p class="explanation" style="color: rgb(20, 220, 80);">I want to go to these schools because it will enhance my learning capabilities by giving me opportunities for more technology based courses, which I enjoy, as technology is my passion.
              For UFA, I would like to go there, like I said, because of the technology based courses, and for the nice learning environment. 
              At UFA's open house, I was impressed by their school, due to the organization, cleanliness, hospitality, and of course, <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The Wednesday Program</span>.

                I do have past experience in this field, as I know how to code to make websites, such as the one you're reading right now
                I use Github to host these, and sometimes use github pages to make these real websites, like this one.

            <h4  style="color: rgb(20, 160, 220);">And that just about sums up why I would like to go to these schools, the reason I have this passion, and my past experience in this field.</h4>
